Two living spaces, a dining room, and two bedrooms means communal living with plenty of room to retreat. Two bikes are an alternative way to get around. As your host, I am only a yard and a fence away.\n\n1940's bungalow in the core of Austin's coolest historic neighborhoods—Travis Heights. Within walking and bike-riding distance of downtown, South Congress and ACL at Zilker Park. The house sleeps 6 (one queen bed, two twin beds and two sleeper sofas) and has 2 bathrooms (one with a shower and one with a bathtub) and an updated kitchen. Original wood trim and painted wood floors, a mid-century eclectic vibe, and lots of love makes this a happy and beautiful place to stay. \n\nThe house is nestled in a quiet, urban neighborhood one mile from South Congress and it's variety of good restaurants, food trailers, boutiques and clubs. Two miles from Downtown Austin and all it has to offer. And about 5 miles from Zilker Park. I have ridden my bike to ACL and avoided parking craziness and I have ridden or walked to SXSW music along So. Congress, downtown and points in between. \n\nClose to the hike and bike trail along Lady Bird Lake. Three blocks from Stacey Park and lap pool (open every day, year round). Three blocks from a the Whip In, a club, convenience store, bar and Indian restaurant. \n\nThe house sits up high on a hill and the front porch is the sweet spot. Good breezes and plenty of seating make it the best place to sit on a starry night. \n\nWasher and dryer and dishwasher. Streetside parking is the common method in this neighborhood. There is access to an alley side parking spot if desired.\n\nYou will have access to the entire home, it's spacious front yard and small fenced backyard.\n\nMy home is on the other side of the fence and behind this bungalow. I will be mostly accessible throughout the day unless I'm in meetings or traveling.\n\nI am definitely biased, but Travis Heights is THE Austin neighborhood to live in. It's hilly, green, quirky, laid back, and close to everything that makes Austin unique.\n\nSouth Congress is a travel destination with shops, restaurants, clubs and bars. Other lesser known details:\n\nStacey Pool is open year round and it’s free and really close! on the corner of East Side and Live Oak. Stacey Park runs between Live Oak and Riverside. It has a walkable trail that ends at a playground, basketball hoop and tennis courts.\n\nNearby access to the Ladybird Lake Hike and Bike trail and boardwalk is just off of Riverside Dr. east of Joe’s Crab Shack.\n\nThis house is centrally located so walking to South Congress is about a 15 minute walk. I also walk into downtown regularly but I am a walker and build in an extra 45 minutes to do so. The Austin metro bus system is not the easiest to use. There are bus stops along South Congress that can take you into downtown. Austin's traffic can be very challenging but my house is close to many restaurants and shops so your drive time will be low. Right now Austin doesn't have Uber or Lyft but we do have other rideshare companies: Fasten, RideAustin, and Fare are the three big ones and work easily by App. I also have two bikes available for your use and a private parking spot if you'd prefer to not park on the street.\n\nPlease note that while this home has two full bathrooms, there is only one shower and one bathtub.","I'm hoping that people can treat the house as a no-shoe zone and leave their shoes outside or right inside the door.
